# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on improving the visual design of the current navigation system (Header and Sidebar components) to align with Subframe's minimalist design philosophy while maintaining all existing functionality. The goal is to create a cleaner, more polished navigation experience that emphasizes content-first approach, generous white space, and minimal visual noise without changing how the navigation currently works.

## Requirements

2. WHEN the user sees the header THEN it SHALL contain only the logo/brand name and essential user actions

5. WHEN the header is displayed THEN it SHALL use the defined color palette (#6366F1 primary, grayscale neutrals)

5. WHEN the sidebar is rendered THEN it SHALL have generous white space and clean typography
6. WHEN navigation items are listed THEN they SHALL have optimal spacing for best UX while maintaining all functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user accessing the application on mobile devices, I want a clean mobile navigation that follows the same minimalist principles, so that I have a consistent experience across all devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views the application on mobile THEN the navigation SHALL adapt to a bottom tab bar pattern
2. WHEN mobile navigation is displayed THEN it SHALL show only essential navigation items (Dashboard, Releases, Create, Settings)
3. WHEN the user taps navigation items on mobile THEN they SHALL have immediate feedback without fancy animations
4. WHEN the mobile navigation is rendered THEN it SHALL maintain the same color scheme and typography as desktop
