## 1. Introduction & Vision

### 1.1 Product Vision
To become the go-to micro-SaaS solution for development teams and product managers to effortlessly generate, publish, and distribute professional, AI-powered release notes, freeing up valuable time and improving communication with stakeholders.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
Manually compiling release notes from completed development tickets (e.g., Linear, GitHub Issues, Jira) is a repetitive, time-consuming, and often inconsistent process. Teams struggle to:

* Accurately capture all relevant shipped changes.
* Summarize technical details into user-friendly updates.
* Maintain a consistent format and tone.
* Distribute notes effectively to internal stakeholders and external customers/subscribers.
* Keep a public-facing, easily accessible history of releases.

This leads to wasted developer/PM time, outdated or missing release notes, and poor communication regarding product updates.

### 1.3 Goals & Objectives
* **Goal 1:** Reduce the time spent creating release notes by at least 80% for target users.
* **Goal 2:** Improve the consistency and quality of release notes published by users.
* **Goal 3:** Provide a seamless workflow from ticket completion to published and distributed notes.
* **Objective 1:** Achieve X number of signups within Y months post-launch.
* **Objective 2:** Achieve a user satisfaction score (CSAT/NPS) of Z regarding the quality of generated notes.

### 1.4 Target Audience
* **Primary:** Product Managers, Engineering Managers, Lead Developers in SaaS companies, software agencies, and internal tool teams.
* **Secondary:** Marketing Managers, Technical Writers, Startup Founders.

### 1.5 Guiding Principles
* **Automation:** Automate as much of the process as possible.
* **Simplicity:** Easy to set up, configure, and use.
* **Quality:** Generate accurate, well-written, and professional notes.
* **Flexibility:** Allow customization of content and distribution.

## 10. Implementation Considerations

### Key Simplifications
1. **Authentication:** Magic links only (no password management)
2. **Integration:** Linear only (focused API integration)
3. **Minimal Custom Styling:** Use ShadCN components with minimal customization
4. **Fixed Categories:** Pre-defined categories instead of custom ones
5. **Limited Editor Functionality:** Basic Markdown without advanced features
6. **Single-Organization:** One organization per user initially
7. **Static Prompts:** Fixed AI prompts without customization options

### Development Approach
* Start with functioning end-to-end flow before adding features
* Implement basic versions of each component first
* Focus on reliability over additional features
* Gather user feedback before expanding functionality
