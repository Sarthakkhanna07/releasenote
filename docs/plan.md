# Releasenote App Dashboard Launch Plan

## Sync Status
- Last PRD/plan alignment and user flow gap review: **July 7, 2025**
- All major PRD section 10 user flow gaps identified and mapped to plan.md tasks.
- Next: Incrementally implement and validate all remaining items in both docs.

## Notes
- User wants a detailed review of the codebase and docs.
- Dashboard implementation exists in codebase; needs assessment for completeness and user journey.
- Goal is to identify what is done, what is pending, and what is broken.
- Slack/email integrations, analytics dashboard, and dashboard monitoring/analytics are deferred until all else is done (per user direction).
- Route consolidation started: legacy dashboard route removed; client-side unauth redirect being implemented.
- Final objective: Make the dashboard live and support a normal user journey.
- Currently using Radix UI primitives (including toast), but user is considering switching to a Tailwind-based or other React UI library for dashboard components and notifications.
- Researching best Tailwind/React UI libraries for dashboard and notification stack simplification.
- Decision: Migrate dashboard to shadcn/ui for components and react-hot-toast for notifications; update docs and ensure smooth transition.
- Notification system migrated: Configuration form now uses react-hot-toast for feedback.
- New approach: For each user flow screen specified by user, validate existence, describe functionality, verify it works, and report/add issues to plan.md.
- User requested to push current code to GitHub before further refactoring/rebuild.
- Codebase snapshot committed and pushed to GitHub before configuration page rewrite.
- PRD and user flow gaps reviewed; plan and /docs/prd.md updated and synced (July 2025)
